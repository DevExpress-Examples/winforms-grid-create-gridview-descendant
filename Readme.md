# WinForms Data Grid - How to create a GridView descendant and use it at design-time

In v16.1+, you can use the `Custom Data Grid` template shipped as part of the [DevExpress Template Gallery](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/16492/whats-installed/template-gallery) to create a [GridView](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView) descendant with pre-built infrastructure classes.

This example demonstrates how to create a custom view (`GridView` descendant) from scratch. The descendant View allows users to delete records by pressing the `Delete` key. Open the solution and build the project before opening `Form1` in the Visual Studio designer.

## How it Works - Descendant View Concept

1. Create descendants of the following classes and implement custom functionality:
    * `GridView` - The component that exposes customization settings and references all infrastructure classes.
    * `GridControl` - The UI control that you place on the form. This is a container for the View.
    * `GridInfoRegistrator` - Contains the View's registration information.
    * `GridHandler` - Processes mouse and keyboard actions.
    * `GridViewInfo` - Calculates display information used to draw View elements.
    * `GridViewPrintInfo` - Calculates the information required to print the View.
2. Override the `ViewName` property for the `GridView` descendant. This property should return a unique View name.
3. Register the `GridView` descendant for design-time use:
    * Create a `GridInfoRegistrator` class descendant. Its `ViewName` property must return the same value as your View's `ViewName` property.
    * Override the `RegisterAvailableViewsCore` method in your `GridControl` descendant.
    * If you want the custom `GridControl` to create an instance of the `GridView` descendant on the grid's initialization, override the `GridControl.CreateDefaultView` method.
    * Mark your grid control with the `[ToolboxItem(true)]` attribute and rebuild the solution to display the custom `GridControl` in the Visual Studio Toolbox.
